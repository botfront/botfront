# Disambiguating user input

When your virtual assistant receives a user utterance, it calculates, for each intent in your domain, the confidence that the utterance is an instance of that intent. Sooner or later, your virtual assistant will be faced with utterances where none of the calculated confidences are particularly high.

It’s very often best to treat these cases separately, since it may mean that your virtual assistant does not understand, or is unsure. Within the Rasa framework, this is done using [policies](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/core/policies/).

### Example usage

```yaml
policies:
...
  - name: rasa_addons.core.policies.BotfrontDisambiguationPolicy
    fallback_trigger: 0.30
    disambiguation_trigger: '$0 < 2 * $1'
    deny_suggestions: 'deny_suggestions'
    n_suggestions: 3
    excluded_intents:
      - ^chitchat\..*
    disambiguation_title:
      en: "Sorry, I'm not sure I understood. Did you mean..."
      fr: "J'ai mal compris. Voulez-vous dire..."
    intent_mappings:
      password_lost:
        en: "Lost password"
        fr: "Mot de passe perdu"
      login_failed:
        en: "Login failed"
        fr: "Problème de connexion"
    deny_suggestions:
      en: "Something else"
      fr: "Autre chose"
...
```

| `fallback_trigger`       | if confidence of top-ranking intent is below this threshold, fallback is triggered. Fallback is an action that utters the template `utter_fallback` and returns to the previous conversation state.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | `string` |
| `disambiguation_trigger` | e.g.: `'$0 < 2 * $1'`): if this expression holds, disambiguation is triggered. (If it has already been triggered on the previous turn, fallback is triggered instead.) Here this expression resolves to "the score of the top-ranking intent is below twice the score of the second-ranking intent". Disambiguation is an action that lets the user to choose from the top-ranking intents using a button prompt.<br/><br/>In addition, an 'Other' option is shown with payload defined in `deny_suggestions` param is shown. It is up to the conversation designer to implement a story to handle the continuation of this interaction. | `string` |
