# Optimization and other features

## Optimize training for faster development

By default, the NLU and all stories are trained when you click on **Train everything** on the right side of the header in Botfront.
Depending on the policies you are using and the number of stories, training can take a significant amount of time. To help you iterate faster on subsets of your dialogue, you may focus on one or multiple story group to train the NLU and just the stories they contain.

You may click on the **focus (eye)** icon which appears when you hover besides story group names. Please note that the blue Train everything button will change to a yellow **Partial training** button, and it will have a tooltip stating the number of stories that are going to be trained.

## Default Domain Management

An important part of developing and maintaining a Rasa virtual assistant is keeping [domain files](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/core/domains/) up to date. Thankfully, Botfront makes this easier by automatically parsing the contents of your stories and extracting the different actions, entities, slots, etc. referenced within.

However, it’s not always possible to infer everything that needs to go into the domain. For example, you might need to invoke a custom action, which in turn invokes another action, or makes use of a slot.

## Warnings and errors

The display of warnings and errors is a very useful part of the story editor. It guides you when you write your stories for them to work properly, and prevents training if there's an error that would affect the model and the chat experience.

When there is a warning or an error, it is flagged on the corresponding line, and also indicated on the story header. When you hover over the icon, you get a suggestive explanation to resolve the issue.

Warnings and errors cover a comprehensive list of possible situations, which are in line with Botfront updates.

## Organizing your stories in groups

Stories are grouped in story groups in order to keep them neat and tidy. You can create as many story groups as you want and rename them if necessary. When you delete the last story in a story group, the group is also deleted.

By selecting the **Move** icon as seen below, you may move any story to any story group.

### Duplicating stories

You may duplicate stories using the **Duplicate** icon next to the Move icon.

## Renaming stories

Stories can be renamed on the story header.

## Collapsing and expanding stories

In order to easily focus on one or a few stories, you can collapse or expand stories using the caret on the left of the story header.

## Special group: Intro stories

The **Intro stories** group contains the initial messages that would be sent to users when they start chatting with your bot. The starting payloads of those stories
will be available in the **bold** menu at the top of the chat widget.

This allows to test different starting workflows, for example if you want the welcome message of your bot to be different on several pages of your website. Note that you will still have to implement that on your frontend. If you are using the Rasa Webchat widget you can do that by customizing the `initPayload` parameter.

The **Intro stories** group is created by default in every new project.
