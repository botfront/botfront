# Contributing to Botfront

If you wish to contribute to Botfront or to make custom changes, here is the recommended way to install and run it on your local machine.

## Install

1. Botfront is a Meteor app, so the first step is to [install Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/install)
2. Then clone this repo and install the dependencies

```bash
git clone https://github.com/botfront/botfront
cd botfront/botfront
meteor npm install
```

<Important type="tip" title="Don't run tests if you have valuable data in your DB">

Meteor comes with its own Node.js and NPM. When installing dependencies, it is better to use the Meteor NPM by running `meteor npm install` than using your local one (`npm install`)

</Important>

## Run

Since Botfront is made of several services you need to start all other services with `docker-compose` from a regular project.

1. Create a Botfront project with `botfront init` (not in the repo, anywhere else on your machine)
2. Start your project with `botfront up -e botfront`. This will run all services except the Botfront app, since you are going to run it with Meteor locallyé
3. Reset meteor from Botfront root folder with `meteor reset` (**this will wipe the database**).
4. Run Botfront with `meteor npm run start:docker-compose.dev`. Botfront will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Documentation

The documentation is located in the `botfront/docs` folder. If you wish to edit the doumentation and preview your changes your can run the documentation on your machine with `npm run docs:dev`.

If you need to build it: `npm run docs:build`

The docs are built with [Vuepress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org)

## Running and writing tests

You can run our integration test suite with `npx cypress run` or interactively with `npx cypress open`

<Important type="warning" title="Don't run tests if you have valuable data in your DB">

The test suite starts by testing the setup process **and will wipe the database**.
