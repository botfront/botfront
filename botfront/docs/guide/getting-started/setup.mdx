Botfront has a few requirements. Please head to [Installing requirements](/docs/getting-started/install-requirements) if you don't have Node or Docker installed

- Linux or macOS (Windows may work but is not officially supported yet, [help is welcome](https://github.com/botfront/botfront/issues/115))
- Chrome (some issues with other browsers)
- A recent version of Docker
- A recent version of Node.js

See the [Installing requirements](/docs/getting-started/install-requirements) section.

### Install the Botfront CLI

```

### Create a new project

```

Botfront will prompt you for a folder name if the current directory is not empty
