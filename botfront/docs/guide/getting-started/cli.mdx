# Useful CLI commands

Botfront comes with a command line interface (CLI) to manage your projects. You can start the CLI by running `botfront` in your terminal. It will open a contextual menu which contains the options you would need most of the time.

## Main commands

| Command          | What it does                | Where to run it          |
| ---------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `botfront init`  | Create a new project        | Anywhere                 |
| `botfront up`    | Start Botfront project      | from your project folder |
| `botfront down`  | Stop Botfront project       | from your project folder |
| `botfront logs`  | View Botfront logs          | from your project folder |
| `botfront watch` | Watch actions files changes | from your project folder |

## Other commands

You can always get help with `botfront --help`

```
Options:
  -V, --version      output the version number
  -h, --help         output usage information

Commands:
  init [options]     Create a new Botfront project.
  up [options]       Start a Botfront project.  Must be executed in your project's directory
  down [options]     Stops a Botfront project and releases Docker resources.  Must be executed in your project's directory
  logs [options]     Display botfront logs. Must be executed in your project's directory
  killall [options]  Stops any running Botfront project
  stop [service]     Stop a Botfront service (interactive). Must be executed in your project's directory
  start [service]    Start a Botfront service (interactive). Must be executed in your project's directory

```

## Using plain `docker-compose` commands

The CLI wraps `docker-compose`. `botfront up` generates `.env` and `.docker-compose.yml` at the root of your project and then invokes `docker-compose up`.
Once those files are generated you can use all `docker-compose` commands from the root of your project.
Note that since those files are generated, any change will be overwritten next time you run `botfront up`. Instead, make changes to the files found in the `.botfront` folder.

## Troubleshooting

Sometimes Docker may complain about a missing network or a conflicting name.
One of these commands will generally fix the problem:

- `botfront down` from your project folder
- `botfront killall` from anywhere
- [`docker system prune`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/system_prune/) from anywhere
