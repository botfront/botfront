# Configuration

## Services and Docker images
The table below lists all the services that can be used with Botfront.

| Service      | Docker image                                                |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| botftont     | `botfront/botfront`                                         |
| botfront-api | `botfront/botfront-api`                                     |
| rasa         | `botfront/rasa-for-botfront`                                |
| duckling     | `botfront/duckling`                                         |
| actions      | Build your own                                              |
| mongo        | `mongo` or hosted service (mLab, Mongo Atlas, Compose, ...) |

<Important type="tip" title="Image tags">

It is not recommended to deploy the images witout tags or with the `latest` tag. Look in the `.botfront.yml` for the tags corresponding to the version of Botfront you are using.

</Important>

Duckling (a structured entity parser developed by Facebook) is not strictly required if your NLU pipeline doesn't use it.

Also, be very careful with your choice regarding MongoDB. If you decide to just run it as a container, be sure to at least properly mount the volume on a physical disk (otherwise all your data will be gone when the container is destroyed) and seriously consider scheduling back-ups on a regular basis.

Using a hosted service such as MongoDB Atlas is highly recommended, some of them even include a free plan that will be more than enough for small projects.

## Environment variables

The following table shows the environment variables required by each service. Be sure to make those available as arguments or in the manifest files of your deployment

| Environment variable | Description                                                                                                                                                                                              | Required by               |

## Volumes

Although volumes are technically not required for Botfront to run and work, if you do not mount them your data will be gone when containers are destroyed.

| Volume        | Description                                                                    | Used by    |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------- |
| `/app/models` | Where Botfront stores the model retured by Rasa when the training is completed | `botfront` |
| `/app/models` | Where Rasa loads a model from when it starts                                   | `rasa`     |
| `/data/db`    | Where MongoDB persists your data                                               | `mongo`    |

`/app/models` should be mounted on the same location so when Rasa restarts it can load the latest trained model.

## MongoDB database considerations

It is **highly** recommended (but optional) to provide an oplog url with `MONGO_OPLOG_URL`. This will improve the reactivity of the platform as well as reduce the network throughput between MongoDB and Botfront.

<Important type="warning" title="IMPORTANT: choose a very short database name">

Choose a very short database name (e.g `bf`) and not too long response names to [avoid hitting the limits](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/limits/#namespaces).

</Important>

## Indicative minimal technical requirements

Those are the minimal requirements:

| Service                      |    RAM | CPU |
| ---------------------------- | -----: | --: |
| botfront                     |   1 Gb |   1 |
| botfront-api                 | 128 Mb | 0.5 |
| duckling                     | 512 Mb | 0.5 |
| rasa (supervised_embeddings) |   1 Gb |   1 |

## Endpoints

Endpoints let you define how your Rasa instance communicates with`:

- the Botfront API to query the bot responses (`nlg`)
- the actions server (`action_endpoint`)
- the tracker store (`tracker_store`)

```yaml
nlg:
  url: "https://<botfront-api-host>/project/bf/nlg"
action_endpoint:
  url: "https://<actions-server-host>/webhook"
tracker_store:
  store_type: rasa_addons.core.tracker_stores.AnalyticsTrackerStore
  url: "https://<botfront-api-host>"
  project_id: "bf"
```
