# Server Installation

Botfront comes as a collection of services delivered as Docker images that you need to orchestrate so they can work together. You have different options.

## Kubernetes / Openshift

Deploying on Kubernetes or Openshift is by far the best option if you are familiar with one of them.
We provide Helm charts to facilitate the installation and deployment:
http://github.com/botfront/botfront-helm


## Single server

An alternative option is to deploy all the services on a single machine. You can get a virtual machine from the Cloud Provider of your choice. We recommend a machine with at least 1 CPU and 2 Gb of RAM

<Important type="warning">

This is for experimentation only. The following installation is not secure and not suitable for production.

</Important>

1. Create a virtual machine with Ubuntu installed, and note the external IP address. For this tutorial, we'll assume the IP address is `123.99.135.3`
2. Install Node.js

```bash
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.35.1/install.sh | bash
export NVM_DIR="$([ -z "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME-}" ] && printf %s "${HOME}/.nvm" || printf %s "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/nvm")"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" # This loads nvm
nvm install lts/erbium
```

3. Install Docker and Docker Compose

```bash
sudo apt-get -y update
sudo apt-get -y remove docker docker-engine docker.io
sudo apt -y install docker.io
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl enable docker
sudo apt install curl
sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.24.1/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```

4. Install Botfront

```bash
npm install -g botfront
botfront init # create a project
```

5. Edit the `botfront.yml` file

```bash
nano .botfront/botfront.yml
```

In the `env` section, change the `root_url` to the machine IP address (leave the port 8888 unchanged)

```yaml
env:
  ...
  root_url: 'http://123.99.135.3:8888'
  ...
```

6. Launch Botfront

```bash
botfront up
```

7. Open Botfront in your browser (`http://123.99.135.3:8888`) and setup your project
8. Go to settings/credentials and change the `base_url` host to the IP address (keep the host unchanged)

```yaml
rasa_addons.core.channels.webchat.WebchatInput:
  session_persistence: true
  base_url: http://123.99.135.3:5005
  socket_path: "/socket.io/"
```

9. Botfront is ready to use.
