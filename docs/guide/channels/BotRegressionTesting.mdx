# Automated conversation flow testing in rasa

Botfront provides automated conversation flow testing to enable quick validation of existing your flows.

The BotRegressionTesting channel simulates a user having a conversation with your chatbot. It validates that the text of each user event in a conversation is parsed with the same intents and entities, and that the bot responses generated from a test run match the bot responses in the test.

## Configure the channel

This channel is configured by default when you run Botfront locally with the CLI.

1. Go to **Settings -> Credentials**
2. Add the following to the yaml

```yaml
rasa_addons.core.channels.bot_regression_test.BotRegressionTestInput: {}
```

## Test story format

Test stories must be a sequence of user events and bot utterances in yaml format.

Each user event must have a user key which contains the message that will be parsed by rasa.
You can refer to the following example test story.

```yaml
- user: /get_started
  entities: []
  intent: get_started
- action: utter_get_started
- user: good morning
  entities:
    - entity: timeOfDay
      value: morning
      start: 5
      end: 12
  intent: chitchat.greet
- action: utter_hi
```
