# Automated conversation flow testing in rasa

Botfront provides automated conversation flow testing to enable quick validation of existing your flows.

The BotRegressionTesting channel simulates a user having a conversation with your chatbot. It validates that when the text of each user event is parsed by rasa it will return the same intents, entities, and bot responses as identified by the bot response name.

## Configure the channel

This channel is configured by default when you run Botfront locally with the [CLI](/docs/getting-started/cli).

1. Go to **Settings -> Credentials**
2. Add the following to the yaml

```yaml
rasa_addons.core.channels.bot_regression_test.BotRegressionTestInput: {}
```

## Test story format

Test stories must be a sequence of user events and bot utterances in yaml format.

Each user event must have a user key which contains the message that will be parsed by rasa.
You can refer to the following example test story.

```yaml
- user: /get_started
  entities: []
  intent: get_started
- action: utter_get_started
- user: good morning
  entities:
    - entity: timeOfDay
      value: morning
      start: 5
      end: 12
  intent: chitchat.greet
- action: utter_hi
```

## Test run payload

The following is an example payload used to initiate a test run.
