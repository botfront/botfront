# Test sequence stories

Once a conversational flow has been created it is important to ensure it continues to work. Botfront conversational testing is designed to help with this.

A test story is a sequence of user and bot events that represents a full conversation between a user and a chatbot. 

The custom BotRegressionTesting channel handles conversational test runs. It simulates a user entering each user event into the chatbot and verrifies that the parse data and resulting bot responses match the current expected.
Note that only the bot response name is validated, not it's content.

Tests are language specific as the user events are parsed by rasa. In the dialogue menu only the test in the current language are displayed. An exception to this is made for failing tests which are always displayed in the Failing Tests smart group.

## Creating Tests

Tests are created from conversations that you have had with your chatbot. There are two ways to do this.

1. Creating via the webchat pannel

In the webchat pannel clicking on the KENTON icon will create a new test from the current conversations
