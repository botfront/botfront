## Overview

- while multiple auth methods are possible we recomend ssh as it ususally give finer detailed accesss conversational
- Ideally create a ssh key which is only used for the repo with your project and has push and pull permission
- Ideally one project per repo
- ssh keys are not encrypted but only accessbile by users with the git-settings:r permission
- ssh keys are not exported to the repo or in any ecport files created using the export feature

## Setup

- while they are many ways to auth use ssh
- create a key
- add key to botfront
- specify the branch!!!!!!

## Using git integraion

- push, revert
- if you attempt to revert to a commit but have unpushed changes it will push a commit with the current state before reverting
- if no changes have been made, the push will fail. (sometimes botfront will make modifications to data behind the scenes so you can push even without explicitly making changes)
