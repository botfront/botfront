## Overview

Git integration leverages the import and export files to assist with bot versioning.


## Setup

In Settings -> Git integration you can set the git repository where your project will be stored along with the public and private SSH keys required to access that repo.
Note that the SSH keys are stored as is in your project so we recomend limiting their rights to the minimum required to push and pull to the repo with your Botfront project.
