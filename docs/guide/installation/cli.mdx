# Using the Botfront CLI

Botfront comes with a command line interface (CLI) to manage your projects.
The CLI is useful to scaffold projects and launch all required services (Botfront, Rasa, Duckling, MongoDB,...).

You can start the CLI by running `botfront` in your terminal.
It will open a contextual menu which contains the options you would need most of the time.

Note that You can use the CLI when Botfront is installed on your local machine or on a single server, but not on a cluster.

## Main commands

| Command          | What it does                | Where to run it          |
| ---------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `botfront init`  | Create a new project        | Anywhere                 |
| `botfront up`    | Start Botfront project      | from your project folder |
| `botfront down`  | Stop Botfront project       | from your project folder |
| `botfront logs`  | View Botfront logs          | from your project folder |
| `botfront watch` | Watch actions files changes | from your project folder |

## Other commands

You can always get help with `botfront --help`

```

## Using plain `docker-compose` commands

The CLI wraps `docker-compose`. `botfront up` generates `.env` and `.docker-compose.yml` at the root of your project and then invokes `docker-compose up`.
Once those files are generated you can use all `docker-compose` commands from the root of your project.
Note that since those files are generated, any change will be overwritten next time you run `botfront up`. Instead, make changes to the files found in the `.botfront` folder.

## Troubleshooting

Sometimes Docker may complain about a missing network or a conflicting name.
One of these commands will generally fix the problem:

- `botfront down` from your project folder
- `botfront killall` from anywhere
- [`docker system prune`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/system_prune/) from anywhere
