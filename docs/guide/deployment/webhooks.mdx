# Webhooks

Some Botfront features implies being able to communicate with the underlying IT infrastructure.
Since every infrastructure is specific, some feature may require custom implementation to be available in Botfront.
For example, restarting a Rasa instance, uploading medias, or deploying are very specific on how your IT infrastructure is organized.

Webhooks allow a deeper integration in your IT environment.

You can define webhooks at the platform lever in **Admin -> Settings -> Webhooks**.

## Available webhooks

```js
{
    "projectId": string,
    "environment" : string,
}
```

#### Expected response

This route does not return a an object. Botfront only expects the http status code.

}
```

    "uri": string // the publicly accessible URI for the asset to be deleted
